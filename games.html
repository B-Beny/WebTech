                        <p style="font-size: 225%;">December 1988 - Japan<br>
                            The winter was chilly but electric in Kamurocho, the premier entertainment district in the east. Here, money buys luxury, and luxury is a way of life. With the nation's economy at the height of a boom, the people of Kamurocho believed that nothing they could wish for was out of reach. But there are some places where money only goes so far.<br>
                            A vacant lot. A humble square of concrete and weeds, hardly the size of a parking space.<br>
                            The Kamurocho 21st Century Revitalization Project is underway, and to own the land is to hold the power. Whoever can obtain the final piece in the puzzle, this tiny patch of ground, will have the leverage to change the balance of the city and spearhead a mammoth commercial property known as the Millennium Tower. Two men are flung into a conflict they do not yet comprehend. Those in power have every intent of burying them in this sea of change, unaware that they were setting events into motion that would give birth to legends.</p>

                            The year is 1995, and Kazuma Kiryu, the Dragon of Dojima, is an up-and-coming yakuza. A Lieutenant Advisor in the Tojo Clan's Dojima Family, his hard work has nearly earned him his own sub-family in this prestigious group.<br>
                            But one rainy night, the unthinkable happens. Sohei Dojima, Patriarch of the Dojima Family, kidnaps Kiryu's childhood friend, Yumi. In an effort to save her, Kiryu's sworn brother, Akira Nishikiyama, rushes after them.<br>
                            As the thunder claps, gunshots ring out from the Dojima Family office. Kiryu arrives to find Nishikiyama holding the smoking gun over Dojima's dead body, and Yumi in shock from the trauma.<br>
                            Kiryu makes a decision that will change his life forever. Sending Nishikiyama out of the room to look after Yumi, Kiryu picks up the gun as the police arrive to arrest the culprit...<br>
                            The year is 2005. Akira Nishikiyama has become a changed man. Yumi is nowhere to be found. Ten billion yen has gone missing from the Tojo Clan's coffers, putting the organization on the brink of civil war. And Kazuma Kiryu is released from prison to a world he no longer recognizes.

                                Kazuma Kiryu thought his Tojo Clan days were behind him. He and his young ward, Haruka Sawamura, have built a peaceful life from the ashes of conflict. All it took was a single gunshot to shatter that peace. Yukio Terada, the fifth chairman of the Tojo Clan, has been assassinated. With war on the horizon, the legendary Dragon of Dojima is pulled back into the world he wanted to leave behind.<br>
                                With the Tojo Clan weakened from the events of 2005 and on the brink of war with the Omi Alliance, Kiryu himself journeys to Kansai to broker peace. But in Sotenbori, the Dragon of Kansai, Ryuji Goda, sees an opportunity: Destroy the Tojo Clan, destroy Kiryu, and become the one true dragon.<br>
                                As a power struggle begins between east and west, a tragedy buried for over 20 years boils to the surface, shaking the very foundation of both organizations.<br>
                                What fate awaits Kazuma Kiryu? What dark truths will be illuminated? And when two dragons have clashed, and the ashes settle over Kamurocho, who will be left standing?

                                A snowy night in 2012...<br>
                                More than a million fans watching a concert<br>
                                were shocked by an idol's sudden confession:<br><br>
                                "Kazuma Kiryu is my family."<br><br>
                                In that moment, an idol became human again.<br>
                                For Haruka Sawamura, the dream had changed.<br><br>
                                Meanwhile, Kazuma Kiryu, the Dragon of Dojima,<br>
                                has just put a decisive end to the yakuza's war of five cities.<br><br>
                                The snow fell gently as Kiryu and Haruka reunited.<br>
                                It should have been the beginning of simpler times...<br>
